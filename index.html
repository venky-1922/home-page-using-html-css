    <p class="content">Most software developers work in offices, where they work with other software developers, publishers, and other
        professionals, depending on their projects. However, software developers can also work in the comfort of their
        homes and submit their progress through digital means. Software developers work full-time and spend 40 hours a
        day. They may work additional hours, depending on their progress and deadline. Software developers develop
        applications and computer programs, which may take longer work hours. Comments, suggestions, and revisions from
        their colleagues or clients can also extend the work hours of software developers.</p>
